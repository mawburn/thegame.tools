# Components

Quick and dirty way to share components between packages. No Storybook or anything, which could be optimized.

Tailwind should be kept with base styles so that each repo using the component can style the component itself. s

## TODO

Figure out how to compile Tailwind classes for each consumer. Some styles are lost and I'm not sure why or how. Weird things, like standard color or widths.
